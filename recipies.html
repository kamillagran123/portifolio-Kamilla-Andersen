                <h2>Case</h2>

                <p>Plan and design a desktop application with a simple 
                    but at the same time clear function.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p> This is an app for electric cars to see where the nearest charging station is.
                        After some research on existing apps, I wanted to create a more user-friendly solution. 
                        This app contains a search field that shows your 
                        location and where the nearest charger is. In addition to dark and light mode.
                         </p>
                    

  
                    
               
            </td>

            <td id="rightImage" class="animated jackInTheBox" style="animation-delay:2.2s;"></td>
            
            </td>

           
           
        </tr>
    </table>
