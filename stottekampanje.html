                <h2>Case</h2>

                <p>Create a support campaign, which consists of a campaign website and associated ads where the goal
                     is to encourage involvement. We chose to shed light on the challenges that electric scooters create for visually impaired people.</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>We chose to conduct a user survey to gain a deeper understanding of who the target group actually is and then be able to decide on a concept to be able to 
                        reach the target group in the best possible way. 
                        We arrived at the following concept:
                        "Not everyone can see the problem".
                        The website contains a video and pictures to shed light on the issue and the challenges that exist, 
                        as well as encouragement in the form of text. With this we believe that
                        the target group gets a wake-up call which in turn leads to action.
                        
                        
                         </p>
                    

  
                    
               
            </td>

            <td id="rightImage" class="animated jackInTheBox" style="animation-delay:2.2s;"></td>
