                <h2>Case</h2>

                <p>“How can Aftenposten present news and relevant content for millennials
                     to increase usage and engagement among the target audience?”</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>A short and free summary to capture and interest users wanting to read more.
                        The application lets the user choose categories for their interests and save 
                        articles quickly in the application. The new design contains a lot more of visual content
                         and agile solutions which suits the target group, especially when it comes to
                         scroll behaviour.
