                <h2>Case</h2>

                <p>“How to create data visualization based on quantitative data in a clear, 
                    contextual and relevant way, which in return will form the basis for the development 
                    of internal tools in the future?”</p>

                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>Inspiration was taken from colors that Åpenhet already uses in its presentation.
                        In addition, a kind of origami style has been chosen where there is a lot of use of triangles, 
                        it is characterized by the fact that you can fold it. 
                        In the final prototype, emphasis is placed on clear images and a small accompanying 
                        text that explains what has been produced, but in an exciting way where the user has to hold over 
                        certain points for the information to appear. In addition to a clear 
                        menu that makes it easy to understand where you are in the presentation.
